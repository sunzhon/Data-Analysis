The modelAnalyze folde contains the project to analyze the self-organized locomotion using mathematical models including controller and robots.
It is used to reveal the essential reason why the decoupled CPGs controlling the robot can generate self-organized locomotion.

It has two version of the modelAnalyze.

The version two is the latest version. It transfer the robot model to a QP question, and then use it to calculate the predictable GRFs iteratively.
